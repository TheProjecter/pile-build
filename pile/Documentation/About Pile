Pile is a truly cross-platform automatic build tool.  It is used to produce files or effects from the inputs it is given in a Pilefile (for example, creating a program executable from source files).  Real programming language features are used to describe a build.  Common functionality is built in for convenience.

As an alternative to Make (most commonly GNU Make), Pile has several features which make it much easier to use and make the description files portable to various operating systems.

Pile was created on June 3rd, 2009.
